BUBBLE MERGER
=============

MILESTONE 1: Create & show proxy bubbles on the map
MILESTONE 2: Remove bubbles that should be in proxy bubbles

mapBubble -> proxyBubble | null
updateInfo -> updateMapBubble | updateProxyBubble


Bubbles can be added to and removed from a ProxyBubble
 - when added / removed / moved
 - at any other time, i.e. map zoom

When bubbles enter/exit proxy bubbles, they are removed/added to BubbleMapLayer


When not in a proxy, all updates go directly to BubbleMapLayer
When in a proxy, all updates go to BubbleMapLayer via the proxyBubble
