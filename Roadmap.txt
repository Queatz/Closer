Implementation Notes
====================

Quest maps automagically connect and layout QuestProgresses
  If a sub- or super- quest is not started, it shows as just name,
    otherwise, it shows as the full QuestProgress
      - Tap on just name = Start Quest / Open Quest

What to show on Quest Cards:

Looking at Quest group ->
    22 times
    Everyone you can see via friendships, including you
    Quest map shows all relations collapsed
        No checkmark
Looking at QuestProgress group ->
    22 remaining
    Just friends are visible
    Quest map only shows active quests as expanded
        Completed get checkmark
        Unstarted get collapsed version
